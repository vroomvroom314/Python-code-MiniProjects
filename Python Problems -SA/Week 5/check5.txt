Be sure to watch the videos very carefully, and not just
skip ahead to the parts required to answer these questions!

Be *very brief* in your answers!  Seriously.  Brief.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Your full name and andrew id:
	Shivum Agarwal
	shivuma	

2. The full names and andrew id's of your groupmates, if you worked in a group.

3. Dates/times that you watched the videos listed in check5.html (fill this out as you go):

	September 25 10:34 pm to 11:09pm
	Finished all videos

4. Total time this check required (fill this out when you are done):
	Needed about half an hour

5. 2d Lists Questions

5.1: Describe why "[ [0] * cols ] * rows" is not a good way to allocate a 2d list.

	It only creates one good row, thee others are all aliases.

5.2: if a = [ [ 1, 2, 3 ] , [ 4, 5, 6] ] what is len(a)? len(a[1])?

	len(a) = 2
	len(a[1]) = 3

5.3: Why do we use two loops (nested) in order to iterate through a 2d list? (As opposed to one loop.)

	One loop is for going through each list within the index of the big list, and another loop through the loop within the index.

5.4: In the context of a 2d list, describe the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy.  What is a situation where deep copy still isn't good enough?

	A shallow copy holds aliases to the original while a deep copy actually creates a real copy that does not reference the original. Deep copy still preserves aliases in a. 

5.5: Why did we write a custom version of print2dList(a) instead of just calling print(a)?

	Print(a) only prints out 2d lists in a single line fashion, not in multiple rows,

5.6: Why does accessing a whole column require a loop, but accessing a whole row does not?
	Python doesn’t provide a way to get a direct column but it lets you access rows seamlessly. As such, a loop is required. Columns aren’t stored


5.7: if a = [ [ 1, 2 ] , [ 4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10] ] what is len(a)? len(a[2])?

	len(a) = 3
	len(a[2]) = 4

5.8: Describe a problem scenario that a 3d list would help you solve.

	They can be used for storing 2 dimensional coordinates within a larger list for a game like tetris.	

That's it!  Carpe diem!
