Be sure to watch the videos very carefully, and not just
skip ahead to the parts required to answer these questions!

Be *very brief* in your answers!  Seriously.  Brief.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Your full name and andrew id:
	Shivum Agarwal
 	shivuma
2. The full names and andrew ids of your groupmates, if you worked in a group.
	

3. Dates/times that you watched the videos listed in check11.html (fill this out as you go):
		November 6 3:03pm to 4:11pm


4. Total time this check required (fill this out when you are done):

		About 1 hour

5. OOP Part 2

5.1. What is the difference between a superclass and a subclass?
	a superclass is the class from which methods are inherited and a subclass is the one that actually inherits the methods from superclass.

5.2. What does super().__init__(x) do?

	it calls the init from the super class instead of the sub class.

5.3. Using the code from 1.3, add two new lines that print type(b) == object and isinstance(b, object). What are the results? Why do you think you got these results?
 		
		print(type(b) == object) == False
		print(isinstance(b, object)) == True
This occurred because b is an instance of the class B() so it is an object. However, it is not directly equal to object itself.


5.4. Give an example of a case where you might want to use a class attribute and a case where you might want to use a static method.

A static method is better when you are dealing with multiple classes and are trying to use functions that are meant to only be used for a specific class.

An attribute is something that should be implemented when you want a similar trait between all instances of a class


5.5. Section 4 demonstrates how you can access the properties of an instance with __dict__. Write a line of code that assigns a new property to an instance of A using __dict__.

Scurry = Player(“Best PG ever”)
Scurry.__dict__[“GOAT”]

5.6. What core method needed to be added to make MovingDot move?

the step method was vital because otherwise there would have been no increment in the dot x coordinates

5.7. Let's say we want to change our code to make the dots squares instead of circles. Where in the code should we make this modification?

In the draw method 

5.8. Why is it a bad idea to check if drawnCard.suit == 1?

	drawnCard.suit can cause an error
